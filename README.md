# VEX-VRC-2020-21
Code used for the 914C 2020-2021 robot

This code was used by team 914C during their 2020-21 VRC season. All commits to this branch are designed with the "Change Up" season in mind.

This code is VEXCODE V5 Block code that has been converted to text for the sake of archival (and looking professional). The code should work without issue when plugged into VEXCODE V5. I cannot guarentee compatibility with other programming software.

All versions of this program are configured to be driven using the "cheesy" control style unless otherwise noted in the commit description.

This code is protected under the MIT License. In other words, do whatever you want with it!
